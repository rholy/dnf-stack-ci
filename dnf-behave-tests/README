Creating test data
------------------

1. Populate repositories (in fixtures/spec):
   * Define RPM packages by .spec files
   * Define groups in comps.xml
   * Define updateinfo in updateinfo.xml
   * Define modules in modules.yaml

2. Define GPG keys and signed packages (in fixtures/gpgkeys):
   * For each GPG key, create a file containing list of package paths that are
     to be signed
   * The name of the GPG key will be the name of the file
   * Package paths must be relative to fixtures/repos
   * Resulting public key will be in fixtures/gpgkeys/keys/<name>/<name>-public

3. Define broken packages:
   * Update script fixtures/spec/break-packages.sh

4. Build: # fixtures/spec/build.sh

5. Create repo files (in fixtured/repos.d)


Test repositories
-----------------

dnf-ci-scriptlets
    purpose:
        Packages to test DNFs reaction on lua scriptlets half failing
        and half succeeding.
    pakcages:
        Package-pre-ok
        Package-pre-fail
        Package-pretrans-ok
        Package-pretrans-fail
        Package-post-ok
        Package-post-fail
        Package-posttrans-ok
        Package-posttrans-fail
        Package-preun-ok
        Package-preun-fail
        Package-postun-ok
        Package-postun-fail
        

dnf-ci-fedora-updates-testing
    purpose:
        Additional new versions for packages and most importantly contains
        identical package as dnf-ci-fedora-updates (CQRlib-1.1.2-16.fc29.spec)
        created by symlink, which is needed by repo-packages-remove-or-reinstall
        feature
    packages:
        CQRlib:
            symlinked to CQRlib in dnf-ci-fedora-updates
        flac:
            additional new version
        kernel:
            additional new version

dnf-ci-thirdparty
dnf-ci-thirdparty-updates
    purpose:
        Home for packages made up just for tests and which are not part
        of the Fedora.
    packages:
        SuperRipper:
            in the dnf-ci-thirdparty version it requires the abcde. In
            the dnf-ci-thirdparty-updates is this dependency dropped. Used
            for testing of autoremove command.
        FlacBetterEncoder:
            this package supplements super feature to the flac package. Used
            for testing of backward dependencies.

dnf-ci-fedora-thirdparty-modular
    purpose:
        Home for packages made up for testing modular dependencies.
    packages:
        egg
        ham
        orange
        strawberry
    modules:
        ingredience (streams: egg, ham, ...)
