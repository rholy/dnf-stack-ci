Feature: Tests for createrepo_c compression options


Scenario: Empty repo with --general-compress-type zstd compression
 When I execute createrepo_c with args "--general-compress-type zstd ." in "/"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And repodata "/repodata/" are consistent
  And repodata in "/repodata/" is
