Feature: Various tests sqliterepo_c


Background: Prepare repository folder
Given I create symlink "/createrepo_c-ci-packages" to file "/{context.scenario.repos_location}/createrepo_c-ci-packages"


Scenario: Sqlitedbs already exist, sqliterepo_c without --foce should faild
Given I execute createrepo_c with args "." in "/"
  And repodata "/repodata/" are consistent
 When I execute sqliterepo_c with args "." in "/"
 Then the exit code is 1
  And stderr is
      """
      Repository already has sqlitedb present in repomd.xml (You may use --force)
      """


Scenario: Sqlitedbs should be created
Given I execute createrepo_c with args "--no-database ." in "/"
 When I execute sqliterepo_c with args "." in "/"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And repodata "/repodata/" are consistent
  And repodata in "/repodata/" is
