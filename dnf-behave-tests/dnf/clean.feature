Feature: Testing dnf clean command


Scenario: Ensure that metadata are unavailable after "dnf clean all"
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-rich"
   When I execute dnf with args "makecache"
   Then the exit code is 0
   When I execute dnf with args "repoquery cream -C"

   When I execute dnf with args "clean all"
   Then the exit code is 0
   When I execute dnf with args "repoquery cream -C"

    And stderr is
