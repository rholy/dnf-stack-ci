Feature: Tests for command aliases availability


Scenario: "nonexistent" is not an alias for any dnf command
   When I execute dnf with args "nonexistent -h"
   Then the exit code is 2
   And stderr is
   """
   Unknown argument "nonexistent" for command "dnf5".
   It could be a command provided by a plugin, try: dnf5 install 'dnf5-command(nonexistent)'
   """


Scenario Outline: "<alias>" is an alias for "<command>"
   When I execute dnf with args "<alias> -h"
   Then the exit code is 0
    # The exact output is now under discussion
    # And stdout contains "Usage:\n.*<command>"
    And stdout contains "Usage:\n"
    And stdout does not contain "Unknown argument"
    And stderr does not contain "Unknown argument"
