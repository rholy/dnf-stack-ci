Feature: Test drop-in directories for configuration files


Scenario: Config files from the drop-in directories are loaded
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I create file "/etc/dnf/libdnf5.conf.d/exclude-filesystem.conf" with
        """

   When I execute dnf with args "install filesystem wget lame flac setup"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr is

Scenario: In case of the same file name, /etc/dnf/libdnf5.conf.d/... masks usr/share/dnf5/libdnf.conf.d/...

Scenario: The /etc/dnf/dnf.conf is loaded last
