Feature: Transaction history undo - comps


Background:
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty"
    And I successfully execute dnf with args "group install dnf-ci-testgroup"
   Then Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                           |
        | group-install | DNF-CI-Testgroup                  |
        | install-group | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64    |
        | install-group | lame-0:3.100-4.fc29.x86_64        |
        | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch      |
        | install-dep   | lame-libs-0:3.100-4.fc29.x86_64   |
    And History is following
        | Id     | Command                               | Action        | Altered   |
        | 1      | group install dnf-ci-testgroup        |               | 5         |

Scenario: Undo a transaction that removed a group
  Given I successfully execute dnf with args "group remove dnf-ci-testgroup"
   When I execute dnf with args "history undo last"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action                 | Package                                       |

        | 1      | group install dnf-ci-testgroup        |               | 5         |


Scenario: Undo a transaction with a missing group
  Given I drop repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty"
   # The group is stored in system state (it can always be removed)
   When I execute dnf with args "history undo 1"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action                 | Package                                       |

   # Undo the last undo (this should install the group again but it is missing)
   When I execute dnf with args "history undo last"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr is
