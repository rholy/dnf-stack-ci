Feature: Transaction history undo


Background:
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"


Scenario: Undoing transactions
  Given I successfully execute dnf with args "install filesystem"
   Then History is following

        | 1      | install filesystem    | Install       | 2         |
   When I execute dnf with args "history undo last"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
