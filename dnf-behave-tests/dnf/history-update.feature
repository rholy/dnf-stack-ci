Feature: History of update

Background:
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"

Scenario: History of update packages
   # `install setup` step added so that `install abcde` was not the first
   # transaction in history. Dnf due to some error is not able to
   # rollback the very first transaction.
   When I execute dnf with args "install setup"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch              |
   Then the exit code is 0
   When I execute dnf with args "install abcde"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
