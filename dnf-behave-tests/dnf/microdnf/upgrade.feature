Feature: Upgrade single RPMs


Background: Install RPMs
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty"
    # "/usr" directory is needed to load rpm database (to overcome bad heuristics in libdnf created by Colin Walters)
    And I create directory "/usr"
   When I execute microdnf with args "install glibc flac wget SuperRipper"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And microdnf transaction is
        | Action        | Package                                   |
