Feature: Obsoleted packages

# dnf-ci-obsoletes repo contains:
# PackageA in versions 1.0 and 3.0
# PackageA-Obsoleter, which provides PackageA in version 2.0 and obsoletes PackageA < 2.0
# PackageA-Provider which provides PackageA in versin 4.0

Background: Use dnf-ci-obsoletes repository
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-obsoletes"


# PackageA has a split in its upgrade-path both PackageA-Obsoleter-1.0-1 and PackageA-3.0-1 are valid.
# PackageA-3.0-1 is picked because it lexicographically precedes PackageA-Obsoleter-1.0-1.

   When I execute dnf with args "install PackageA"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |

# PackageE has a split in its upgrade-path both PackageA-Obsoleter-1.0-1 and PackageE-3.0-1 are valid.
# PackageA-Obsoleter-1.0-1 is picked because it lexicographically precedes PackageE-3.0-1.
