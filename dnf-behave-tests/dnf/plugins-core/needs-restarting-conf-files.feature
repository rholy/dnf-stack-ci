Feature: Add package to needs-restarting using config files

Background:
Given I enable plugin "needs_restarting"
  And I use repository "needs-restarting"
  And I move the clock backward to "before boot-up"
  And I execute dnf with args "install wget abcde"
  And I move the clock forward to "the present"
  And I use repository "needs-restarting-updates"
  And I create directory "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d"
  And I create and substitute file "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d/wget.conf" with
  """
  wget
  """

Scenario: plugin does not fail if config directory not found
Given I delete directory "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d/"
