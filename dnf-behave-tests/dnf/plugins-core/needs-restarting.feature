Feature: Reboot hint

Background:
    Given I enable plugin "needs_restarting"
      And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
      And I move the clock backward to "before boot-up"
      And I execute dnf with args "install lame kernel basesystem glibc wget"
      And I move the clock forward to "the present"
      And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"

Scenario: Update core packages
    Given I execute dnf with args "upgrade kernel basesystem"
      And I execute dnf with args "upgrade glibc"
      And I execute dnf with args "upgrade lame wget"
     When I execute dnf with args "needs-restarting -r"
     Then the exit code is 1
      And stdout is
          """
          Core libraries or services have been updated since boot-up:
