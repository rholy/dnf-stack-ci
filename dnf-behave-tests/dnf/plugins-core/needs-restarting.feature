Feature: Reboot hint

Background:
    Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
      And I move the clock backward to "before boot-up"
      And I execute dnf with args "install lame kernel basesystem glibc wget lz4"
      And I move the clock forward to "the present"
      # Boot time is measured down to the second, so sleep for one second so
      # the time packages are installed is at least one second after container
      # boot
      And I sleep for "1" seconds
      And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"
