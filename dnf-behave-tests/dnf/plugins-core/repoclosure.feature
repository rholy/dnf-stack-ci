Feature: Repoclosure command tests


# we need to override the default value for the `best` config option
Background:
  Given I configure dnf with
        | key   | value |
        | best  | False |


Scenario: Run repoclosure without any options
  Given I use repository "repoclosure"
    And I use repository "repoclosure-lookaside"
   When I execute dnf with args "repoclosure"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stdout is
    """

Scenario: Run repoclosure with a package specified
  Given I use repository "repoclosure"
    And I use repository "repoclosure-lookaside"
   When I execute dnf with args "repoclosure dedalo"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stdout is

Scenario: Run repoclosure with --arch option
  Given I use repository "repoclosure"
    And I use repository "repoclosure-lookaside"

Scenario: Check closure only for specified repo
  Given I use repository "repoclosure"
    And I use repository "repoclosure-lookaside"
   When I execute dnf with args "repoclosure --check repoclosure"
   Then the exit code is 0


Scenario: Check closure with --newest (consider only the latest package in each repo)
  Given I use repository "repoclosure"
    And I use repository "repoclosure-lookaside"
   When I execute dnf with args "repoclosure --newest"
   Then the exit code is 1
