Feature: Tests excluding capabilities of the versionlock plugin


Background: Set up versionlock infrastructure in the installroot
  Given I create file "/etc/dnf/versionlock.toml" with
    """
    version = "1.0"
    [[packages]]
    name = "wget"
    [[packages.conditions]]
    key = "evr"
    comparator = "!="
    value = "0:1.19.6-5.fc29"
    """
  # check that both excluded and newer versions of the package are available
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"
   When I execute dnf with args "repoquery wget"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout is
    """
    <REPOSYNC>
    wget-0:1.19.5-5.fc29.src
    wget-0:1.19.5-5.fc29.x86_64
    wget-0:1.19.6-5.fc29.src
    wget-0:1.19.6-5.fc29.x86_64
    """


Scenario: The excluded newest version of the package is not installed
   When I execute dnf with args "install wget"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | wget-0:1.19.5-5.fc29.x86_64           |


Scenario: The excluded version of the package is not installed as a dependency
   When I execute dnf with args "install abcde"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | abcde-0:2.9.3-1.fc29.noarch           |
