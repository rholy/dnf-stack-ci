Feature: Versionlock command can maintain versionlock.list file


Background: Set up versionlock infrastructure in the installroot
  Given I enable plugin "versionlock"
  # plugins do not honor installroot when searching their configuration
  # all the next steps are merely to set up versionlock plugin inside installroot
  And I configure dnf with
    | key            | value                                     |
    | pluginconfpath | {context.dnf.installroot}/etc/dnf/plugins |
  And I create and substitute file "/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.conf" with
    """
    [main]
    enabled = 1
    locklist = {context.dnf.installroot}/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.list
    """
  And I create file "/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.list" with
    """
    """


Scenario: Basic commands add/exclude/list/delete/clear for manipulation with versionlock.list file are working
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
   When I execute dnf with args "install wget"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following

   # add is the default command
   When I execute dnf with args "versionlock wget"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout is

Scenario: Versionlock accepts --raw switch
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
   When I execute dnf with args "install flac"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
