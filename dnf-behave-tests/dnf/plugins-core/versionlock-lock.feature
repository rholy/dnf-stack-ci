Feature: Tests locking capabilities of the versionlock plugin


Background: Set up versionlock infrastructure in the installroot
  Given I enable plugin "versionlock"
  # plugins do not honor installroot when searching their configuration
  # all the next steps are merely to set up versionlock plugin inside installroot
  And I configure dnf with

    | pluginconfpath | {context.dnf.installroot}/etc/dnf/plugins |
  And I create and substitute file "/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.conf" with

  Given I successfully execute dnf with args "install wget-1.19.5"
   When I execute dnf with args "reinstall wget"
