Feature: Protect running kernel


Background: Install fake kernel
  Given I use repository "protect-running-kernel"
    And I successfully execute dnf with args "install dnf-ci-kernel --exclude dnf-ci-obsolete"
    And I fake kernel release to "1.0"

Scenario: Running kernel is protected
   When I execute dnf with args "remove dnf-ci-kernel"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr is
        """
        Error: 
         Problem: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: dnf-ci-kernel
