Feature: Protect running kernel


Background: Install fake kernel
  Given I use repository "protect-running-kernel"
    And I successfully execute dnf with args "install dnf-ci-kernel --exclude dnf-ci-obsolete"
    And I fake kernel release to "1.0"

   # This test doesn't test obsoletes.
   When I execute dnf with args "upgrade --exclude dnf-ci-obsolete  dnf-ci-kernel"
