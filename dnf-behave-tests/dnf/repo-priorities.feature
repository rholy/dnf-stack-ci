Feature: Repositories with priorities


Background: Use repositories with priorities 1, 2, and 3
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-priority-1" with configuration
        | key      | value |
        | priority | 1     |
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-priority-2" with configuration
        | key      | value |
        | priority | 2     |
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-priority-3" with configuration
        | key      | value |
        | priority | 3     |


Scenario: Install an RPM from the highest-priority repository and ensure that upgrade will not install update from the lower priority repository
   When I execute dnf with args "install flac"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | flac-0:1.3.3-2.fc29.x86_64                |
   When I execute dnf with args "upgrade"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is empty


Scenario: Install an RPM of specific version from lower-priority repository
   When I execute dnf with args "install flac-1.3.3-3.fc29"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | flac-0:1.3.3-3.fc29.x86_64                |


Scenario: Install RPMs from different highest-priority repositories
   When I execute dnf with args "install flac *system"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
