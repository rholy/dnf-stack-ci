Feature: Tests for rich (boolean) dependencies:
 and - requires all operands to be fulfilled for the term to be True.
 or - requires one of the operands to be fulfilled
 if - requires the first operand to be fulfilled if the second is (reverse implication)
 if else - same as above but requires the third operand to be fulfilled if the second is not
 with - requires all operands to be fulfilled by the same package for the term to be True.
 without - requires a single package that satisfies the first operand but not the second (set subtraction)
 unless - requires the first operand to be fulfilled if the second is not (reverse negative implication)
 unless else - same as above but requires the third operand to be fulfilled if the second is
