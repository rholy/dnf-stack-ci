Feature: Test that proper hints are printed after resolving failure

Background: Set dnf for strict behavior
  Given I use repository "resolve-hints"
    And I configure dnf with
        | key                       | value             |
        | best                      | True              |
        | skip_unavailable          | False             |
        | skip_broken               | False             |
        | optional_metadata_types   | comps,updateinfo  |

# non-existing DoesNotExist package to all install commands.
