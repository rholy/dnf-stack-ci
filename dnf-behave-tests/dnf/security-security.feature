Feature: Test security options for update


Background: Use repository with advisories
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-security"
   When I execute dnf with args "install security_A-1.0-1 security_B-1.0-1"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                   |
        | install       | security_A-0:1.0-1.x86_64 |
        | install       | security_B-0:1.0-1.x86_64 |


Scenario: Security check-update when there are no such updates
  Given I drop repository "dnf-ci-security"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
   When I execute dnf with args "check-update --security"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout does not contain "security_A"
    And stdout does not contain "security_B"


Scenario: Security check-update when there are such updates
   When I execute dnf with args "check-update --security"
   Then the exit code is 100
    And stdout contains "security_A.*1\.0-4\s+dnf-ci-security"
    And stdout does not contain "security_B"
