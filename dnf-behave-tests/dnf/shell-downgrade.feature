Feature: Shell downgrade


Background: Install glibc and flac
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"
   When I execute dnf with args "install glibc flac"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                    |
        | install       | glibc-0:2.28-26.fc29.x86_64                |
        | install       | flac-0:1.3.3-3.fc29.x86_64                 |
        | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch               |
        | install-dep   | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64             |
        | install-dep   | basesystem-0:11-6.fc29.noarch              |
        | install-dep   | glibc-common-0:2.28-26.fc29.x86_64         |
        | install-dep   | glibc-all-langpacks-0:2.28-26.fc29.x86_64  |

Scenario: Using dnf shell, downgrade an RPM
   When I open dnf shell session
