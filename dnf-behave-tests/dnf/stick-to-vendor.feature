Background:
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-vendor-1"

   And I successfully execute dnf with args "install vendor"
   Then the exit code is 0
   And transaction is following
       | Action  | Package             |
       | install | vendor-1.0-1.x86_64 |

  Given I successfully execute rpm with args "-qi vendor"
   Then the exit code is 0
   And stdout contains "Vendor      : First Vendor"
