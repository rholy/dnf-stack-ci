Feature: Upgrade RPMs from path


Background: Install glibc, wget
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
   When I execute dnf with args "install glibc wget"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | glibc-0:2.28-9.fc29.x86_64                |
        | install       | wget-0:1.19.5-5.fc29.x86_64               |
        | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch              |
        | install-dep   | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64            |
        | install-dep   | basesystem-0:11-6.fc29.noarch             |
