Feature: DNF config files testing

# Scenarios, that need changes in host /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
# Scenario: Create dnf.conf file and test if host is using /etc/dnf/dnf.conf.
# Scenario: Create dnf.conf file and test if host is taking option -c /test/dnf.conf file (absolute and relative path)
# Scenario: Test without dnf.conf in installroot (dnf.conf is not taken from host)
# Scenario: Reposdir option in dnf conf.file in host

Scenario: Test removal of dependency when clean_requirements_on_remove=false
