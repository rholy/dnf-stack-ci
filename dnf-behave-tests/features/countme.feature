    @fixture.httpd.log
    Scenario: Custom User-Agent value
        Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora" as http
          And I set config option "user_agent" to "'Agent 007'"

    Scenario: Countme flag is sent once per week
        Given I set config option "countme" to "1"
          And today is Wednesday, August 07, 2019
          And I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
          And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora" as http
          And I set up metalink for repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
          # The countme feature only activates when refreshing the metalink so
          # we need one first.
          And I execute dnf with args "makecache"
         # One in the first 4 requests is randomly chosen to include the flag
         # (see COUNTME_BUDGET=4 in libdnf/repo/Repo.cpp for details)
         When I execute dnf with args "check-update --refresh" 4 times
         Then exactly one metalink request should include the countme flag
         # Same week
         When today is Friday, August 09, 2019
          And I execute dnf with args "check-update --refresh" 4 times
         Then no metalink request should include the countme flag
         # Next week
         When today is Tuesday, August 13, 2019
          And I execute dnf with args "check-update --refresh" 4 times
         Then exactly one metalink request should include the countme flag

    @fixture.httpd.log
    Scenario: Countme feature is disabled
