Scenario: Installing a package upgrade with best will not pull in secondary arch packages (non-trivial dependency tree)
Given I successfully execute dnf with args "install foo-1.0-1.x86_64"
 When I execute dnf with args "install foo --best"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                        |
      | upgrade       | foo-2.0-1.x86_64               |
      | upgrade       | python3-foo-2.0-1.x86_64       |
      | upgrade       | python3-foo-clibs-2.0-1.x86_64 |
