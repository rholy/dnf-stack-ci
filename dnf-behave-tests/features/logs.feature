Scenario: Log rotation keeps file permissions
Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"

    # Set permissions to 600
  And I successfully execute "chmod 600 {context.dnf.installroot}/var/log/dnf.log"

  And I successfully execute "chmod 600 {context.dnf.installroot}/var/log/dnf.rpm.log"
    # Run dnf again, so that files are rotated
 When I execute dnf with args "--setopt=log_size=100 --setopt=log_rotate=2 remove flac"
