Scenario: Install packages from local repodata that have packages with xml:base pointing to a remote as well as local packages
#4. local repo with local and remote packages; installing both at the same time.
Given I make packages from repository "dnf-ci-fedora" accessible via http
  And I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
  And I copy repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty" for modification
  And I execute "createrepo_c --baseurl http://localhost:{context.dnf.ports[dnf-ci-fedora]} /{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-fedora].path}"
  And I execute "mergerepo_c --repo file://{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-fedora].path} --repo file://{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-thirdparty].path}" in "{context.dnf.installroot}"
  And I configure a new repository "merged-repo" with
      | key     | value                                        |
      | baseurl | file://{context.dnf.installroot}/merged_repo |
  When I execute microdnf with args "install abcde alternator"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And microdnf transaction is
      | Action        | Package                                   |
      | install       | FlacBetterEncoder-0:1.0-1.x86_64          |
      | install       | flac-0:1.3.2-8.fc29.x86_64                |
      | install       | abcde-0:2.9.2-1.fc29.noarch               |
