Feature: repository-packages info

Scenario: List info of all packages from repository
Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "install filesystem"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                                  |
      | install       | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64           |
      | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch             |
 When I execute dnf with args "repository-packages dnf-ci-fedora info all"
 Then the exit code is 0
 Then stdout contains "Source\s+:\s+glibc-2.28-9.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then stdout contains "Available Packages"
 Then stdout contains "Installed Packages"
 Then stdout contains "Name\s+:\s+wget"
 Then stdout contains "Version\s+:\s+1.19.5"
 Then stdout contains "Architecture|Arch\s+:\s+src"
 Then stdout contains "Size\s+:\s+6.6 k"
 Then stdout contains "Source\s+:\s+None"
 Then stdout contains "Repository|Repo\s+:\s+dnf-ci-fedora"
 Then stdout contains "Summary\s+:\s+A utility for retrieving files using the HTTP or FTP protocols"
 Then stdout contains "URL\s+:\s+http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"
 Then stdout contains "License\s+:\s+GPLv3+"
 Then stdout contains "Description\s+:\s+[a-zA-Z ]*"


Scenario: List all installed packages from repository
Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "install setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
 When I execute dnf with args "repository-packages dnf-ci-fedora info installed"
 Then the exit code is 0
 Then stdout contains "Installed Packages"
 Then stdout contains "Source\s+:\s+setup-2.12.1-1.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then stdout does not contain "Source\s+:\s+glibc-2.28-9.fc29.src.rpm"


Scenario: Single repository package info
Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "install setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
 When I execute dnf with args "repository-packages dnf-ci-fedora info setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
 Then stdout contains "Installed Packages"
 Then stdout contains "Source\s+:\s+setup-2.12.1-1.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then stdout does not contain "Source\s+:\s+glibc-2.28-9.fc29.src.rpm"


Scenario Outline: List repo <extras alias> - installed from repo, but not available anymore
# use temporary copy of repository dnf-ci-fedora for this test
Given I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
  And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "install setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                                  |
      | install       | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch             |
Given I delete file "/{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-fedora].path}/noarch/setup-2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch.rpm"
 Then the exit code is 0
Given I delete file "/{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-fedora].path}/src/setup-2.12.1-1.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And I generate repodata for repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 Then the exit code is 0
 When I execute dnf with args "clean expire-cache"
 Then the exit code is 0
 When I execute dnf with args "repository-packages dnf-ci-fedora info <extras alias>"
 Then the exit code is 0
 Then stdout contains "dnf-ci-fedora"
 Then stdout contains "Extra Packages"
 Then stdout contains "Source\s+:\s+setup-2.12.1-1.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then stdout does not contain "Source\s+:\s+glibc-2.28-9.fc29.src.rpm"
 Then stdout does not contain "basesystem"
 Then stdout does not contain "Available Packages"
 Then stdout does not contain "Installed Packages"

Examples:
    | extras alias   |
    | extras         |
    | --extras       |
