Scenario: Install packages from repository "test-1"
 Given I use the repository "test-1"
 When I "install" a package "TestA, TestD, TestF, TestK" with "dnf"
 Then package "TestA, TestB, TestD, TestE, TestF, TestG, TestH, TestK, TestM" should be "installed"
 And package "TestC" should be "absent"

 When I "upgrade" a package "all" with "dnf"
 Then package "TestA, TestB, TestD, TestE, TestF, TestG, TestH, TestM" should be "upgraded"
 And package "TestC" should be "absent"
